                "The Geocentric model is a model of the universe with the Earth at its centre. Greek philosophers believed that celestial objects should move in circular paths because the circle was the most perfect figure according to Plato. But it was clear that the planetary motion could not be modelled with a single circular motion about the Earth. To explain these effects the Greek astronomers developed increasingly complex systems of spheres carried on other spheres, or circles carried on larger circles. This system of explaining the planetary motions reached its culmination with the work of Claudius Ptolemy (ca 100-170 AD). His model for the planetary motions which is based on the geocentric model, and an even more elaborate system of circles on circles (or \"epicycles\"). This epicycles model was necessary to explain features such as the retrograde motion of the planet Mars. There are times when Mars appears to move backward relative to the stars compared with the normal east to west motion most of the time.\n" +

                "It wasn't until 1543 that there was a challenge to the Ptolemaic system. This was when Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus published his book De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres). The Copernican system provided a simpler explanation of the retrograde motion of Mars. It occurred as a result of Earth catching up with, and passing Mars due to its faster orbital motion. But Copernicus still used the platonic idea of circular motions and so he still needed systems of multiple circles to explain the actual motions of the planets (which move on elliptical, rather than circular orbits). \n" +

It was described in his book the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, usually just known as the Principia, published in 1687.\n" +
                "•\tNewton showed that the elliptical orbits that Kepler had found were exactly what was expected if the planets were attracted to the Sun by a universal force of gravitation that acts between any two objects in the universe and depends on their mass.\n" +
                "•\tIn particular, he realised that the force that explains the orbits of, for example, the Moon around the Earth, is the same force that causes objects to fall to the ground and causes the phenomenon of weight.\n" +
                "•\tHe drew the picture above showing that if an object, such as a cannonball, were fired with sufficient speed from a high mountaintop, it would not fall to Earth, because the curvature of the Earth would fall away at the same rate as the cannonball would fall, and thus it would complete an orbit of the Earth.\n",

Indeed, one of the objections that had been proposed to the Copernican theory was that we should expect the motion of the Earth to change the apparent positions of stars. A nearby star should change its position relative to the background of more distant stars as the orbit of the Earth moved it around the Sun. This effect is known as stellar parallax. If it could be detected, then it would provide a way of measuring the distances of stars.\n" +

                "The failure to observe such parallax was used as an argument against the Copernican theory.\n" +
                "However, the reason it could not be measured was mostly because the stars are so distant, that the parallax movement is extremely small. In fact, it is less than one second of arc for even the nearest stars, and could not be measured until techniques for the accurate measurement of star positions reached the requisite precision.\n" +
                "The first successful measurement of stellar parallax was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel. He measured the parallax of the star 61 Cygni and obtained a distance of 9.8 light years.\n" +
                "Other measurements of stellar parallax rapidly followed, and Alpha Centauri was found to be the closest star system to our own Sun at a distance of about 4.3 light years.\n" +
                "These measurements helped confirm not only that the Earth really does orbit around the Sun, but also what had long been expected - that the stars were other suns. The distances measured were consistent with stars being objects as bright as the Sun but seen from much greater distances.\n",

As telescopes became more powerful, we realised that the number of stars in our Milky Way galaxy was in the billions. In fact it is now thought there are several hundred billions of stars in the Milky Way. The Milky Way has a diameter of about 100000 light years.\n" +
